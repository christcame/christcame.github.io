This repository contains the source files for my personal static website hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is made up of HTML, CSS, and image assetsâ€”no build step is required.

## Viewing the Site Locally
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. From the project root, run:
   ```
   python -m http.server
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to view the site.

## Deployment
Updates pushed to the **main** branch are automatically published via GitHub Pages. Commit your changes and push to deploy.
