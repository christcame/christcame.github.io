This repository contains the source files for my personal static website hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is made up of HTML, CSS, and image assetsâ€”no build step is required.

## Viewing the Site Locally
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. From the project root, run:
   ```
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   The command serves the site on port 8000.
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view the pages.
4. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C` when you are done.

## Deployment
Updates pushed to the **main** branch are automatically published via GitHub Pages. Commit your changes and push to deploy.
