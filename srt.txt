This article is about the social phenomenon sometimes formerly called **"St. Vitus' dance."** For the infection resulting in jerking movements more often called by that name, see **Sydenham's chorea**.

Dancing mania (also known as **dancing plague**, **choreomania**, **St. John's Dance**, **tarantism** and **St. Vitus' Dance**) was a phenomenon that may have had biological causes, which occurred primarily in **mainland Europe between the 14th and 17th centuries**. It involved groups of people dancing erratically, sometimes thousands at a time. The mania affected adults and children who danced until, allegedly, they collapsed from exhaustion and injuries, and sometimes died. One of the first major outbreaks was in **Aachen**, in the Holy Roman Empire (within modern-day Germany), in **1374**, and it quickly spread throughout Europe; one particularly notable outbreak occurred in **Strasbourg in 1518** in Alsace, also in the Holy Roman Empire (now in modern-day France).

Affecting thousands of people across several centuries, dancing mania was not an isolated event, and was well documented in contemporary reports. It was nevertheless poorly understood, and remedies were based on guesswork. Often **musicians** accompanied dancers, due to a belief that music would treat the mania, but this tactic sometimes backfired by encouraging more to join in. There is **no consensus** among modern-day scholars as to the cause of dancing mania. The several theories proposed range from religious cults being behind the processions to people dancing to relieve themselves of stress and put the poverty of the period out of their minds. It is speculated to have been a **mass psychogenic illness**, in which physical symptoms with no known physical cause are observed to affect a group of people, as a form of social influence.

## Definition

**"Dancing mania"** is derived from the term **"choreomania,"** from the Greek *choros* (dancing) and *mania* (madness), and is also known as **"dancing plague."** The term was coined by **Paracelsus**, and the condition was initially considered a curse sent by a saint, usually **St. John the Baptist** or **St. Vitus**, and was therefore known as **"St. Vitus' Dance"** or **"St. John's Dance."** Victims of dancing mania often ended their processions at places dedicated to that saint, who was prayed to in an effort to end the dancing; incidents often broke out around the time of the feast of St. Vitus.

St. Vitus' Dance was diagnosed, in the 17th century, as **Sydenham's chorea**. Dancing mania has also been known as **epidemic chorea** and **epidemic dancing.** A disease of the nervous system, **chorea** is characterized by symptoms resembling those of dancing mania, which has also rather unconvincingly been considered a form of epilepsy.

Other scientists have described dancing mania as a **"collective mental disorder,"** **"collective hysterical disorder"** and **"mass madness."**

## Outbreaks

The earliest-known outbreak of dancing mania occurred in the **7th century.** One of the earliest-known incidents occurred sometime in the **1020s in Bernburg**, where 18 peasants began singing and dancing around a church, disturbing a Christmas Eve service.

Further outbreaks occurred during the **13th century**, including one in **1237** in which a large group of children travelled from Erfurt to Arnstadt (about 20 km (12 mi)), jumping and dancing all the way, in marked similarity to the legend of the **Pied Piper of Hamelin**, a legend that originated around the same time. Another incident, in **1278**, involved about 200 people dancing on a bridge over the **River Meuse** resulting in its collapse. Many of the survivors were restored to full health at a nearby chapel dedicated to St. Vitus. The first major outbreak of the mania occurred between **1373 and 1374**, with incidents reported in England, Germany and the Netherlands.

On **24 June 1374**, one of the biggest outbreaks began in **Aachen**, before spreading to other places such as Cologne, Flanders, Franconia, Hainaut, Metz, Strasbourg, Tongeren, Utrecht, and regions and countries such as Italy and the Duchy of Luxemburg. Further episodes occurred in **1375 and 1376**, with incidents in France, Germany, and the Netherlands, and in **1381**, there was an outbreak in Augsburg. Further incidents occurred in **1418 in Strasbourg**, where people fasted for days and the outbreak was possibly caused by exhaustion. In another outbreak, in **1428 in Schaffhausen**, a monk danced to death and, in the same year, a group of women in Zürich were reportedly in a dancing frenzy.

Another of the most extensive outbreaks occurred in **July 1518, in Strasbourg** (see Dancing plague of 1518), where a woman began dancing in the street, and between 50–400 people joined her. Further incidents occurred during the **16th century** when the mania was at its peak: in **1536 in Basel**, involving a group of children; and in **1551 in Anhalt**, involving just one man. In the **17th century**, incidents of recurrent dancing were recorded by professor of medicine Gregor Horst, who noted:

> *Several women who annually visit the chapel of St. Vitus in Drefelhausen ... dance madly all day and all night until they collapse in ecstasy. In this way they come to themselves again and feel little or nothing until the next May, when they are again ... forced around St. Vitus' Day to betake themselves to that place ... \[o\]ne of these women is said to have danced every year for the past twenty years, another for a full thirty-two.*

According to John Waller, although numerous incidents were recorded, the best documented cases are the outbreaks of **1374 and 1518**, for which there is abundant contemporary evidence.

## Characteristics

The outbreaks of dancing mania varied, and several characteristics of it have been recorded. Generally occurring in **times of hardship**, up to tens of thousands of people would appear to dance for hours, days, weeks, and even months.

Women have often been portrayed in modern literature as the usual participants in dancing mania, although contemporary sources suggest otherwise. Whether the dancing was spontaneous, or an organized event, is also debated. What is certain, however, is that dancers seemed to be in a **state of unconsciousness** and **unable to control themselves.**

In his research into social phenomena, author Robert Bartholomew notes that contemporary sources record that participants often **did not reside where the dancing took place.** Such people would travel from place to place, and others would join them along the way. With them they brought customs and behaviour that were strange to the local people. Bartholomew describes how dancers wore **"strange, colorful attire"** and **"held wooden sticks."**

Robert Marks, in his study of hypnotism, notes that some decorated their hair with garlands. However, not all outbreaks involved foreigners, and not all were particularly calm. Bartholomew notes that some **"paraded around naked"** and made **"obscene gestures."** Some even had sexual intercourse. Others **acted like animals,** and **jumped, hopped, and leapt about.**

They hardly stopped, and some danced until they broke their ribs and subsequently died. Throughout, dancers **screamed, laughed, or cried,** and some sang. Bartholomew also notes that observers of dancing mania were sometimes treated violently if they refused to join in. Participants demonstrated odd reactions to the color **red**; in *A History of Madness in Sixteenth-Century Germany*, Midelfort writes that they **"could not perceive the color red at all,"** and Bartholomew reports **"it was said that dancers could not stand ... the color red, often becoming violent on seeing [it]."**

Bartholomew also notes that dancers **"could not stand pointed shoes,"** and that dancers **enjoyed their feet being hit.** Throughout, those affected by dancing mania suffered from a variety of ailments, including **chest pains, convulsions, hallucinations, hyperventilation, epileptic fits, and visions.** In the end, most simply dropped down, overwhelmed with exhaustion. Midelfort, however, describes how some ended up in a **state of ecstasy.** Typically, the mania was **contagious** but it often struck small groups, such as families and individuals.

## Tarantism

Further information: **Tarantism**

In Italy, a similar phenomenon was **tarantism**, in which the victims were said to have been **poisoned by a tarantula or scorpion.** Its earliest-known outbreak was in the **13th century**, and the only antidote known was to **dance to particular music** to separate the venom from the blood. It occurred only in the **summer months.** As with dancing mania, people would suddenly begin to dance, sometimes affected by a perceived bite or sting and were joined by others, who believed the venom from their own old bites was reactivated by the heat or the music. Dancers would perform a **tarantella**, accompanied by music which would eventually **"cure"** the victim, at least temporarily.

Some participated in further activities, such as tying themselves up with vines and whipping each other, pretending to sword fight, drinking large amounts of wine, and jumping into the sea. Sufferers typically had symptoms resembling those of dancing mania, such as **headaches, trembling, twitching and visions.**

As with dancing mania, participants apparently **did not like the color black,** and **women were reported to be most affected.** Unlike dancing mania, tarantism was confined to **Italy and southern Europe.** It was common until the **17th century**, but ended suddenly, with only very small outbreaks in Italy until as late as **1959.**

A study of the phenomenon in 1959 by religious history professor **Ernesto de Martino** revealed that most cases of tarantism were probably **unrelated to spider bites.** Many participants admitted that they had not been bitten, but believed they were infected by someone who had been, or that they had simply touched a spider. The result was mass panic, with a **"cure" that allowed people to behave in ways that were, normally, prohibited at the time.** Despite their differences, tarantism and dancing mania are often considered synonymous.

## Reactions

As the real cause of dancing mania was unknown, many of the treatments for it were simply hopeful guesses, although in some instances they were effective. The 1374 outbreak occurred only decades after the Black Death, and was treated in a similar fashion: **dancers were isolated, and some were exorcised.** People believed that the dancing was a **curse brought about by St. Vitus;** they responded by **praying** and making **pilgrimages** to places dedicated to St. Vitus.

Prayers were also made to **St. John the Baptist,** who some believed also caused the dancing. Others claimed to be **possessed by demons, or Satan,** therefore **exorcisms** were often performed on dancers. Bartholomew notes that **music was often played** while participants danced, as that was believed to be an effective remedy, and during some outbreaks musicians were even employed to play. Midelfort describes how the music **encouraged others to join in,** however, and thus effectively made things worse, as did the dancing places that were sometimes set up.

## Theories

Numerous hypotheses have been proposed for the causes of dancing mania, and it remains unclear whether it was a real illness or a social phenomenon.

* One of the most prominent theories is that victims suffered from **ergot poisoning,** which was known as St. Anthony's fire in the Middle Ages. Ergotism can cause hallucinations and convulsions, but cannot account for the other strange behaviour most commonly identified with dancing mania.
* Other theories suggest that the symptoms were similar to **encephalitis, epilepsy, and typhus,** but as with ergotism, those conditions cannot account for all symptoms.
* Numerous sources discuss how dancing mania, and tarantism, may have simply been the result of **stress and tension** caused by natural disasters around the time, such as plagues and floods. The recurring waves of the Black Death, other natural disasters, would have combined with the dawn of Reformation to make for a great deal of uncertainty and challenge for the people of Europe during this time period.
* Hetherington and Munro describe dancing mania as a result of **"shared stress"**; people may have danced to **relieve themselves of the stress and poverty** of the day, and in so doing, attempted to become ecstatic and see visions.
* According to Deborah Hyde, the spontaneous spread of this phenomenon through social networks played a significant role:
    > *"It’s hard to deny that the dancing mania was marked by **social contagion** exacerbated by stress. Outbreaks occurred along trade routes or reoccurred in the same areas – where people had knowledge of the format, in other words. **Beliefs and behaviour can travel just like pathogens**."*
* Another popular theory is that the outbreaks were all **staged**, and the appearance of strange behaviour was due to its unfamiliarity. **Religious cults** may have been acting out well-organised dances, in accordance with ancient Greek and Roman rituals. Despite being banned at the time, these rituals could be performed under the guise of uncontrollable dancing mania. Justus Hecker, a 19th century medical writer, described it as a kind of festival, where a practice known as **"the kindling of the Nodfyr"** was carried out. This involved jumping through fire and smoke, in an attempt to ward off disease. Bartholomew notes how participants in this ritual would often continue to jump and leap long after the flames had gone.

It is certain that many participants of dancing mania were **psychologically disturbed,** but it is also likely that some took part out of **fear,** or simply wished to **copy everyone else.** Sources agree that dancing mania was one of the earliest-recorded forms of **mass hysteria,** and describe it as a **"psychic epidemic,"** with numerous explanations that might account for the behaviour of the dancers. It has been suggested that the outbreaks may have been due to **cultural contagion** triggered, in times of particular hardship, by deeply rooted popular beliefs in the region regarding angry spirits capable of inflicting a **"dancing curse"** to punish their victims.

**Gin Craze**

**GIN CRAZE**

**From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia**

**Gin Lane** by William Hogarth, 1751; it depicts what was by then considered a "drug crisis."

The **Gin Craze** was a period in the first half of the **18th century** when the consumption of **gin increased rapidly in Great Britain, especially in London.** Daniel Defoe commented: "the Distillers have found out a way to hit the palate of the Poor, by their new fashion'd compound Waters called Geneva, so that the common People seem not to value the French-brandy as usual, and even not to desire it."

Parliament passed **five major Acts, in 1729, 1736, 1743, 1747 and 1751,** designed to control the consumption of gin. Though many similar drinks were available and alcohol consumption was considerable at all levels of society, gin caused the greatest public concern. Although it is commonly thought gin or Jenever was the particular drink that became popular, at that time the word "gin" was also used as a general term for drinks distilled from grain.

***

## Increased consumption of gin

Gin was popularised in England following the accession of **William of Orange in 1688.** Gin provided an alternative to **French brandy** at a time of both political and religious conflict between Britain and France. Between 1689 and 1697, the Government passed a range of legislation aimed at restricting brandy imports and encouraging gin production. Most importantly, the monopoly of the **London Guild of Distillers was broken in 1690,** thereby opening up the market in gin distillation. The production and consumption of English gin, which was then popular among politicians and even Queen Anne, was encouraged by the government. This encouragement was shown in the **reduced taxes** on the distillation of spirits. **No licenses were needed to make spirits** and distillers could have smaller, simpler workshops than brewers, who were required to serve food and provide shelter for patrons.

**Economic protectionism** was a major factor in beginning the Gin Craze; as the price of food dropped and income grew, consumers suddenly had the opportunity to spend excess funds on spirits. By **1721**, Middlesex magistrates were already decrying gin as **"the principal cause of all the vice & debauchery committed among the inferior sort of people."** In 1736, the Middlesex Magistrates complained,

> *It is with the deepest concern your committee observe the strong Inclination of the inferior Sort of People to these destructive Liquors, and how surprisingly this Infection has spread within these few Years ... it is scarce possible for Persons in low Life to go anywhere or to be anywhere, without being drawn in to taste, and, by Degrees, to like and approve of this pernicious Liquor.*

## Gin Acts of 1736 and 1751

Main article: **Gin Act 1751**

The British government tried a number of times to restrict the flow of gin. The **Gin Act 1736** taxed retail sales at a rate of 20 shillings a gallon on spirits and required licensees to take out a **£50 annual licence to sell gin**, a fee equivalent to about £10,000 today. The aim was to effectively prohibit the trade by making it economically unfeasible. **Only two licences were ever taken out.** The trade became illegal, consumption dipped but then continued to rise and the law was effectively **repealed in 1743** following mass law-breaking and violence (particularly towards informers who were paid £5 to reveal the whereabouts of illegal gin shops). The illegally distilled gin which was produced following the 1736 Act was **less reliable and more likely to result in poisoning.**

By **1743**, England was drinking **2.2 gallons (10 litres) of gin per person per year.** As consumption increased, a campaign for more effective legislation began to emerge, led by the Bishop of Sodor and Man, **Thomas Wilson,** who, in 1736, had complained that gin produced a "drunken ungovernable set of people." Prominent anti-gin campaigners included **Henry Fielding** (whose 1751 "Enquiry into the Late Increase in Robbers" blamed gin consumption for increased crime and increased ill health among children), Josiah Tucker, **Daniel Defoe** (who had originally campaigned for the liberalisation of distilling, but later complained that drunken mothers were threatening to produce a "fine spindle-shanked generation" of children) and – briefly – **William Hogarth.** Hogarth's engraving **Gin Lane** is a well known image of the gin craze, and is often paired with **Beer Street,** creating a contrast between the miserable lives of gin drinkers and the healthy and enjoyable lives of beer drinkers.

The Gin Craze began to diminish after the **Gin Act 1751.** This Act **lowered the annual licence fees,** but encouraged "respectable" gin selling by **requiring licensees to trade from premises rented for at least £10 a year.** Historians suggest that gin consumption was reduced not as a result of legislation but because of the **rising cost of grain.** Landowners could afford to abandon the production of gin and this, coupled with population growth and a series of poor harvests, resulted in lower wages and increased food prices. The Gin Craze had mostly **ended by 1757.** The government tried to ensure this by temporarily banning the manufacture of spirits from domestic grain. There was a resurgence of gin consumption during the Victorian era, with numerous "gin palaces" appearing. In 1840, the amount of gin consumed in London (but by that time with a population in excess of one million) finally matched that from when prohibition ended in 1743.

**Mercury poisoning, chronic (neurological symptomatology)**

**Elemental mercury**

Specialty **Emergency medicine**

**Erethism,** also known as **erethismus mercurialis, mad hatter disease, or mad hatter syndrome,** is a neurological disorder which affects the whole central nervous system, as well as a symptom complex, derived from **mercury poisoning.** Erethism is characterized by **behavioral changes** such as **irritability, low self-confidence, depression, apathy, shyness and timidity,** and in some extreme cases with prolonged exposure to mercury vapors, by **delirium, personality changes and memory loss.** People with erethism often have **difficulty with social interactions.** Associated **physical problems** may include a **decrease in physical strength, headaches, general pain, and tremors,** as well as an **irregular heartbeat.**

Mercury is an element that is found worldwide in soil, rocks, and water. People who get erethism are often **exposed to mercury through their jobs.** Some of the higher risk jobs that can lead to occupational exposure of workers to mercury are working in a **chlor-alkali, thermometer, glassblowing, or fluorescent light bulb factory, and working in construction, dental clinics, or in gold and silver mines.** In factories, workers are exposed to mercury primarily through the base products and processes involved in making the final end consumer product. In dental clinics it is primarily through their interaction and installation of dental amalgams to treat dental caries. In the case of mining, mercury is used in the process to purify and completely extract the precious metals.

Some elemental and chemical forms of mercury (**vapor, methylmercury, inorganic mercury**) are more toxic than other forms. The **human fetus** and **medically compromised people** (for example, patients with lung or kidney problems) are the most susceptible to the toxic effects of mercury.

Mercury poisoning can also occur outside of occupational exposures including in the home. **Inhalatio**
