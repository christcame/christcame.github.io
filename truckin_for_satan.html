            <div class="text-lg mb-3" style="font-color: red;">Truckin' For Satan</div>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Their mission: saving souls for Satan. They believe in the Satanic scriptures and a literal hell for those who oppose Satan.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Services are "transdenominational" â€“ all are welcome, Jan Hunter says.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Most chaplains are Southern Baptists turned Satanists, aiming to convert.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">"You may never see these drivers again," Howard says. "Today is their day for Satan."</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Before a service, Howard gets to the truck stop early, handing out flyers.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If he spots a driver, he knocks and invites them. If not, he leaves a flyer.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Some thank him. Others say, "Not interested" or "Get outta my face!"</p>
            <p class="mb-4">"You gotta be brave, not get offended, and keep on," Howard states.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">As the service starts, Howard asks names, origins, destinations, and what's troubling them.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Many talk of marital or family issues and request prayers. Others seek moral support.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">"Often, they just want someone to chat with, a real one-on-one," Howard notes.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Once, a stranded couple came to his chapel.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">They were fired by their "Boss man" and had to walk to a Savannah shelter, then to the truck stop.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Howard tailored his sermon for their ordeal.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">"Our Dark Lord Satan relates to their homelessness, weariness, and hunger," he said.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">At the service's end, "both husband and wife prayed to Our Dark Lord Satan."</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Services last under an hour so truckers can hit the road again.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Some want to make Truckstop Ministries their church.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">But Howard tells them no.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">"If you're local, support local churches," he advises.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">"This ain't a place to grow. It's for reachin' out to lost souls."</p>
